\section{Hello World}

Typically, the first program a programmer writes is one that prints a simple 
message.  The first program in the \textit{C Programming Language} by  Brian 
W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie is a program that prints ``Hello World'' on 
the computer console.  This first piece actually does this, in 12 different 
languages.  Touch a foil covered country on the map of the world and see 
``Hello World'' displayed on the small screen located in the middle of the 
North Atlantic Ocean in the language of the country you touched.

\subsection*{Processing Element}

This piece uses an Adafruit Feather M0 Express.
