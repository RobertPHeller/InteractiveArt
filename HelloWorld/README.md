# HelloWorld

Typically, the first program a programmer writes is one that prints a simple 
message.  The first program in the _C Programming Language_ by  Brian 
W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie is a program that prints "Hello World" on 
the computer console.  This first piece actually does this, in 12 different 
languages.  Touch a foil covered country on the map of the world and see 
"Hello World" displayed on the small screen located in the middle of the 
North Atlantic Ocean in the language of the country you touched.

## Processing Element

This piece uses an Adafruit Feather M0 Express.
