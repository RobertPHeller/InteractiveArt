# Interactive Art 

These are micro-processor based art projects where the viewer can interact in 
some way with the art.  These art items use Arduino and Arduino-like 
micro-processors to provide the "smarts" for the interactivity.

The projects include:

1. [Hello World](tree/master/HelloWorld)
2. [Welcome To Gothem City](tree/master/WelcomeToGothemCity)
3. [Paging Dr. Howard, Dr Fine, Dr. Howard](tree/master/PagingDrHowardEtAl)
4. [Why Did The Chicken Cross The Street](tree/master/WhyDidTheChicken)
5. [The Android's Dream](tree/master/AndroidsDream)
6. [Only Her Hairdresser Knows For Sure](tree/master/OnlyHerHairdresser)
