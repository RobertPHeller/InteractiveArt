\section{The Androids Dream}

This piece was inspired by the question posed in the title of a Philip K. Dick
novel, \textit{Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?}. This piece features an
electric sheep, so it is possibly what every android is dreaming of. This not
merely a stuffed sheep toy, it actually moves like a real sheep, but is
powered by electricity and not by grass (yes, the grass it is lying on is fake
too). Go ahead and pet it. It will raise its head and wag its tail. Don't you
wish you were an android so that this would be the answer to your dreams?

\subsection*{Processing Element}

This piece uses a 3V Adafruit Itsy Bitsy 32u4.

\subsection*{Components of Note}

\begin{itemize}
\item A pair of micro servos (to move the head and tail).
\item Three Light Dependent Resistors (light sensors) to sense when it is dark
(sleep mode) or when being petted.
\item Two micro servos to move the head and tail.
\end{itemize}
