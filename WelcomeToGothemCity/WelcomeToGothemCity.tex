\section{Welcome To Gothem City}

Welcome to Gothem City, home of Batman and Robin. Oh no, the Bat Signal has
lit up the night as we get closer to the city. Does that mean there is a super
villain in town? See if you can find Batman and Robin or the super villain
(there may even be several). 

\subsection*{Processing Element}

This piece uses an Adafruit Metro Mini.

\subsection*{Components of Note}

\begin{itemize}
\item Adafruit Powerboost 1000c to provide extra power and to charge the battery.
\item An SR04 ultrasonic range finder sensor.
\item A TIP120 power transistor.
\item A large number of yellow SMD LEDs to light up the Bat Signal.
\end{itemize}
