\section{Why Did The Chicken Cross The Street}

This piece poses the age old question about chickens crossing roads.  The 
piece does not provide an answer, but does provide for the crossing to be made 
safely.  Press the ``Walk'' button to have the traffic lights change and 
present a green walk signal.

\subsection*{Processing Element}

This piece uses an Adafruit Metro Mini. 

\subsection*{Components of Note}

\begin{itemize}
\item Adafruit Powerboost 500 to provide extra power and to charge the 
battery.
\item Adafruit Bi-Color 8x8 LED Matrix backpack.
\item 10mm Red, Green, and Yellow LEDs.
\end{itemize}
