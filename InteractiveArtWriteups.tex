\section*{About the artist}

Robert Heller is a self-taught computer programmer, who has been writing 
computer programs for nearly half of a century (he started at age 16).  He has 
also been tinkering with electronics for at least as long.  He worked at UMass 
for almost 30 years as a programmer for a research group in the computer 
science department.  He is now mostly retired, but continues to be involved in 
computer programming, both with projects of his own and with other open source 
projects.  Recently he has been working on little projects involving 
little Arduino-like microprocessor board, and has created this collection of 
``Interactive Art'', which is artwork that rather that just sit passively on 
the wall, require the observer to interact with the pieces in some way, thus 
moving the art in to a new direction or dimension.

All of these pieces feature ``Open Source'' circuit designs and software.
There is a GitHub repository containing all of these pieces. The repository is
available on the at the web address
\url{https://github.com/RobertPHeller/InteractiveArt}.\marginpar{\includegraphics{InteractiveArtonGitHub.png}}
These pieces also make use of microprocessor and breakout boards designed and
sold by Adafruit
(\url{https:/adafruit.com/})\marginpar{\includegraphics{adafruitQR.png}}. Lady
Ada and her crew have designed many useful little circuit boards for DIY
hackers.

I have not priced the pieces (I don't really know what they are worth), but if 
you want one, make me an offer.
