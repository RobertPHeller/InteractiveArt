\section*{About the artist}

Robert Heller is a self-taught computer programmer, who has been writing 
computer programs for nearly half of a century (he started at age 16).  He has 
also been tinkering with electronics for even longer.  He worked at UMass 
for almost 30 years as a programmer for a research group in the computer 
science department.  He is now mostly retired, but continues to be involved in 
computer programming, both with projects of his own and with other open source 
projects.  Recently he has been working on little projects involving 
little Arduino-like microprocessor boards, and has created this collection of 
``Interactive Art'', which is artwork that rather that just sits passively on 
the wall, require the observer to interact with the pieces in some way, thus 
moving the art to a new direction or dimension. Visit his personal website at 
\url{https://www.deepsoft.com/~heller/}\marginpar{\includegraphics{hellerQR.png}}.


All of these pieces feature ``Open Source'' circuit designs and software.
There is a GitHub repository containing all of circuit designs and code for
these pieces. The repository is available on the web at the web address
\url{https://github.com/RobertPHeller/InteractiveArt}.\marginpar{\includegraphics{InteractiveArtonGitHub.png}}
Please feel free to make use of these circuit designs and/or software for your
own projects. These pieces also make use of microprocessor and breakout boards
designed and sold by Adafruit
(\url{https:/adafruit.com/})\marginpar{\includegraphics{adafruitQR.png}}. Lady
Ada and her crew have designed many useful little circuit boards for DIY
hackers.  In the individual piece descriptions are listings of the processor 
board used and the major components used.  There is a link to the piece 
specific URL in the repository and links to additional information relating to 
the piece's circuit design and software.

I have not priced the pieces (I don't really know what they are worth), but if 
you want one, make me an offer.
